Various members' attributes are also part of the dataset, including seniority, formal status, office in which they work, gender, lawschool attended, individual performance measurements (hours worked, fees brought in), attitudes concerning various management policy options, etc. This dataset was used to identify social processes such as bounded solidarity, lateral control, quality control, knowledge sharing, balancing powers, regulation, etc. among peers.\n",
