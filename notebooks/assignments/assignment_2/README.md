This assignment is less structured than previous individual assignments.

You are given a collection of approximately 25k tweets that have been manually (human) annotated.  ```class``` denotes: 0 - hate speech, 1 - offensive language, 2 - neither

### 1. Preprocessing and vectorizaion. 
Justify your choices and explain possible alternatives (e.g. removing stopwords, identifying bi/tri-grams, removing verbs or use of stemming, lemmatization etc.)

- Create a bag-of-words representation, apply TF-IDF and dimensionality reduction (LSA-topic modelling) to transform your corpus into a feature matrix.
- Train a word-embedding model of your choice (Word2Vec, GloVe or Fasttext) and use it to calculate average-vector-representations for the tweets.

### 2. Explore and compare the 2 "classes of interest" - hate speech vs offensive language. 

- Can you see differences by using simple count-based approaches?
- Can you identify themes (aka clusters / topics) that are specific for one class or another? Explore them using, e.g. simple crosstabs - topic vs. class and to get more detailed insights within-cluster top (TF-IDF) terms. (This step requires preprocessed/tokenized inputs).

### 3. Build an ML model that can predict hate speech
Use the ML pipeline (learned in M1) to build a classification model that can identify offensive language and hate speech. It is not an easy task to get good results. Experiment with different models on the two types of text-representations that you create in 2.

The best-reported results for this dataset are.

| Class         | Precision     |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 0             |0.61           |
| 1             |0.91           |
| 2             |0.95           |
| Overall       |0.91           |

Here advanced NLP feature engineering has been used, and thus everything around an overall accuracy of 85 is fine. You will see that it is not easy to lift class 0 accuracy over 0.5

Good Luck!
